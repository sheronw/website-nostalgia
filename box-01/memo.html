<h2>The Phoenix and the Turtle</h2>
<p><i>BY WILLIAM SHAKESPEARE</i></p>

      <p>Let the bird of loudest lay <br>
On the sole Arabian tree  <br>
Herald sad and trumpet be,  <br>
To whose sound chaste wings obey. </p>

<p>But thou shrieking harbinger,  <br>
Foul precurrer of the fiend,  <br>
Augur of the fever's end,  <br>
To this troop come thou not near.</p>

<p>From this session interdict  <br>
Every fowl of tyrant wing,  <br>
Save the eagle, feather'd king;  <br>
Keep the obsequy so strict. </p>

<p>Let the priest in surplice white,  <br>
That defunctive music can,  <br>
Be the death-divining swan,  <br>
Lest the requiem lack his right. </p>

<p>And thou treble-dated crow,  <br>
That thy sable gender mak'st  <br>
With the breath thou giv'st and tak'st, <br>
'Mongst our mourners shalt thou go.</p>

<p>Here the anthem doth commence:  <br>
Love and constancy is dead;  <br>
Phoenix and the Turtle fled  <br>
In a mutual flame from hence. </p>

<p>So they lov'd, as love in twain  <br>
Had the essence but in one;  <br>
Two distincts, division none:  <br>
Number there in love was slain. </p>

<p>Hearts remote, yet not asunder;  <br>
Distance and no space was seen  <br>
'Twixt this Turtle and his queen:  <br>
But in them it were a wonder. </p>

<p>So between them love did shine  <br>
That the Turtle saw his right  <br>
Flaming in the Phoenix' sight:  <br>
Either was the other's mine. </p>

<p>Property was thus appalled  <br>
That the self was not the same;  <br>
Single nature's double name  <br>
Neither two nor one was called. </p>

<p>Reason, in itself confounded,  <br>
Saw division grow together,  <br>
To themselves yet either neither, <br>
Simple were so well compounded;  </p>

<p>That it cried, "How true a twain  <br>
Seemeth this concordant one!  <br>
Love has reason, reason none,  <br>
If what parts can so remain." </p>

<p>Whereupon it made this threne  <br>
To the Phoenix and the Dove,  <br>
Co-supremes and stars of love,  <br>
As chorus to their tragic scene: </p>

<h3>threnos</h3>

<p>Beauty, truth, and rarity,  <br>
Grace in all simplicity,  <br>
Here enclos'd, in cinders lie.</p>

<p>Death is now the Phoenix' nest, <br>
And the Turtle's loyal breast  <br>
To eternity doth rest, </p>

<p>Leaving no posterity:  <br>
'Twas not their infirmity,  <br>
It was married chastity. </p>

<p>Truth may seem but cannot be;  <br>
Beauty brag but 'tis not she;  <br>
Truth and beauty buried be. </p>

<p>To this urn let those repair  <br>
That are either true or fair;  <br>
For these dead birds sigh a prayer.</p>
