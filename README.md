# Website Nostalgia

## About this Project

It all started when I saw an interesting comment about one traditional British piano manufacturer's website, which ignoring all fancy stuffs that needed to be a "good website" for programmers, such as responsive design or flat UI. The comment's writer admitted that any front-end engineer will feel uneasy to see such a website. However, he said that he felt the obstinateness of  the tradition by looking this website. As a result, this "bad design" became a fantastic reflection of the personality of the manufacturer, so it should be a "good design". (I tried to find the original tweet but failed, but I am sure this comment was made by [@liruyi](https://twitter.com/liruyi))

This let me to think about a boarder view of websites we see in everyday life. Using the latest technology, or following the standards made by big companies and organizations is, no doubt, a good behavior. But we could not say that those websites which not implementing those are not good.

So I went back to about 10 years ago, when I was in primary school. I found many Japanese websites by accident.  Even though I cannot understand even a little bit of Japanese, I believed that they are cute, or "kawaii" in Japanese.
I believe they are different and totally new for westerners. However, when I managed to check those websites in my bookmarks(yes I am still keeping those bookmarks, and those websites were clearly not in archive.org) several days before, I find that many of them just disappeared permanently. For those websites that are still alive, I'll submit the url to Web Archive and make a record here. I also made several templates using these "style".

## Templates

### 1. novel-01
This is a pretty simple template to exhibit novels. There were many people sharing their novels on their personal websites at that time.

### 2. box-01
This kind of box structure was really popular when I was in the primary school, before the popularization of the smart phone and mobile internet, I think. It is clear that this kind of structure is not "mobile-friendly". I was a little bit lazy so the color is monotonous, but I will write more box template in the future : )
